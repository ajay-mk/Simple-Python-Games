# Simple Python Games

A set of simple games build using Python - a learning exercise for beginners.

I have compiled these from various tutorials around the internet, mainly from YouTube. I will leave some links to these tutorials below.

If you have some games that you want to add, submit a pull request.

Feel free to check out, raise an issue if you see a bug and contribute.
